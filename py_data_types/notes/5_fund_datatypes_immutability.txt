Fundamental Data types: int, float, bool, complex and str.
    All Fundamental data types are immutable data types.
    Except complex all are object reusable.(Doubt) [Compare in IDLE adn PyCharm]

Immutable Objects:  Once we create an object we can not perform any changes on that object.
    We are trying to perform any changes with those changes a new object will be created.
    + Memory utilization
    + Performance improved

PVM-Python virtual memory: if an object is required to create, PVM will check if any object is already available with required content.
PVM will not create it will reuse the existing object.
Object create is costly operation then searching operation.


Python Consle and IDEl are REPL tools: Read Eval Print and Loop.
These tools are not standard tools.
