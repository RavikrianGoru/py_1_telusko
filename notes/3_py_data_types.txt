Data type: Type concept is available
    Dynamically typed: no need to declare type explicitly.
    Every thing in python is Object
    Inbuilt data types:
        int
        float
        bool
        complex

        list
        set
        tuple

        frozenset
        dict
        bytes
        bytearray
        range
        None

Common used functions id(), type() print()

Integer values:
    Decimal form or Base 10: (0-9)
    Binary form or Base 2:(0 and 1): starts with 0b or 0B
    Octal form or Base 8:(0-7): starts with 0O or 0o
    Hexa decimal form or Base 16:(0-9,a-f,A-F): start with 0x or 0X

Base conversion functions:
    bin()
    oct()
    hex()

Floating values:
    Only decimal form 123.456
    exponential from 123456e-3, 12e3, 123456E-3, 12E3

Complex data types:
    a+bj here a is real part , b is imaginary part and j/J value is squar root of -1 or j^2 = -1

    a  real part can be represented in binary/octal/hexa form
    b imaginary part can be represented in only decimal form
    we can perform arithmetic operations with complex numbers.
