we have designed our program around functions i.e.blocks of statements which manipulate data.
This is called the procedure-oriented way of programming.

There is another way of organizing your program which is to combine data and functionality and wrap it inside something called an object.
This is called the object oriented programming paradigm.

Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object oriented programming.
A class creates a new type where objects are instances of the class.

Class-----> Object-1, Object-2...... Object-n

variables of Object/Class : Fields
functions of Class: Methods
Collectively, the fields and methods can be referred to as the attributes of that class.

instance variables:
class variables:

A class is created using the class keyword.
