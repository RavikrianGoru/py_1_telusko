Procedure-oriented programing:
-----------------------------
    Module with functions(blocks of statements which manipulate data)

Object oriented programming:
---------------------------
Combination of data(fields) and functionality(methods) into object type programing

Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object oriented programming.
A class creates a new type where objects are instances of the class.

Field: variables of Object/Class
Method: functions of Class
Attributes: Collectively, the fields and methods can be referred to as the attributes of that class.

A class is created using the 'class' keyword.


Class method must have first param(self) no need to provide value for it. Python will provide it.

The self : reference of current object itself.
    We can give any name for this parameter. Recommended to use name 'self'.


The __init__ method:
    The __init__ method is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated (i.e. created).
    The method is useful to do any initialization (i.e. passing initial values to your object) you
    want to do with your object.
