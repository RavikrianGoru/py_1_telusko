Python features:
    1) Simple & Eacy to learn (35 reserved words)
    2) Freeware & Open source
    3) High-level
    4) Platform independent(PVM) like JVM in java. PVM is platform dependent
    5) Portable
    6) Dynamically Typed
    7) Procedure & Object oriented
    8) Extensible (Can use non-python code ex: java, c...)
    9) Interpreted: Interpreter take cares of compilation(No need to compile explicitly)
    10) Embedded: Python code can be embedded in java, C language.
    11) Extensive library support

Limitation:
    ML: numpy, pandas,matplotlib....
    - Mobile App Dev: No lib support for mobile apps development.
    - Not to E2E End to End Apps(Enterprise Apps: Banking, Telecom apps)
    - Performance is low as it is interpreted in nature
      JIT concept pypy (python for speed)is added in python virtual machine but still not up to the mark.
